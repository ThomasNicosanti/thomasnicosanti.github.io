  <p>I'm a fourth-year PhD student in Geometry and Mathematical Physics at SISSA (Trieste).<br> 
  I'm working on my PhD project about Topological Field Theories and their relation with low-dimensional topology and number theory, under the supervision of Pavel Putrov (ICTP). Together with Johann Quenta-Raygada (SISSA), we are exploring the correspondence between gauge theories with continuous and finite gauge groups.

  <p>I'm one of the organizers of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sissa-junior-gmp/home-page">Junior GMP students' cycle of seminars</a>.</p>
